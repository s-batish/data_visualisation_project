# Data Visualisation Project
The purpose of this project is to clean and and analyse a dataset using Pandas DataFrames and packages like Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualisations. 

I have chosen to analyse a dataset about Google Play Store Apps. This dataset was in the form of a csv file, which I imported and cleaned, before analysing the data through a number of visualisations.

To view this project, simply run the Jupyter Notebook file.

## Structure of the report
### Imports
The following libraries have been imported at the start of the project to make it easy to use them throughout:
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib.pyplot

### Cleaning the data
This sections demonstrates how I transformed the raw data into a dataframe that provided greater use for analysis. I did this in a number of ways, such as removing duplicate rows, formatting the numerical fields to allow calculations on them, and editing the structure of an incorrectly inputted row.

### Data Visualisation
There are a number of visualisations within this section that detail interesting findings I made about the data, and these observations have been noted down below each visualisation.

### Conclusions
At the end of the file, there are some general conclusions that I came to based on what I discovered through the visualisations.
