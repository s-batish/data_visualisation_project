# Data Visualisation Project
The purpose of this project is to clean and and analyse a dataset using Pandas DataFrames and packages like Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualisations. 

I have chosen to analyse a dataset about Google Play Store Apps. This dataset was in the form of a csv file, which I imported and cleaned, before analysing the data through a number of visualisations.

To view this project, simply run the Jupyter Notebook file.
