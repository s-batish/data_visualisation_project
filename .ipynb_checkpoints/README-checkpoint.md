# Data Visualisation Project
The purpose of this project is to clean and and analyse a dataset using Pandas DataFrames and packages like Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualisations. 

I have chosen to analyse a dataset about Google Play Store Apps. This dataset was in the form of a csv file, which I imported and cleaned, before analysing the data through a number of visualisations.

To view this project, simply run the Jupyter Notebook file.

## Conclusions
* The Finance category of apps is the most expensive app category, however, it does not have the most apps within this category, and it also has a bit more of a spread of ratings. Therefore, it could be an idea to increase investment on this sector to capitalise on these higher prices by also improving their apps to ensure they have higher ratings, which would in turn lead to more consumers purchasing these apps.
* The Events sector is another category to consider increasing investment on, since they have, on average, the highest rated apps, menaing that they are performing well, so it could be wise to increase the production of apps within this area and to also think about raising their prices if the apps continue performing this well.
* The Family category of apps has the largest number of apps out of the top paid apps, however the reviews for these apps are not the highest on average. It could be an idea to improve these apps to ensure that the category as a whole performs well, or, conversely, if certain apps are not performings so well and thus are contributing to the lower average ratings, it could be wise to divert attention from these poorly performing apps to the ones that are rated better and are generating greater revenues.
